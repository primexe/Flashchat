# Flash-Chat

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app with basic functionality. Firebase Firestore was used as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 

## What have I used

* Integration of the third party libraries using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* Storing data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* Quering and sorting the Firebase database.
* Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* Creating the custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* The App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* Creating direct Segues for navigation.
